This is a fork from angularjs-gulp-browserify-boilerplate. 
==========================================================

Differences:
- I consider the project structure presented here: https://scotch.io/tutorials/angularjs-best-practices-directory-structure better than the structure of the boilerplate so I use that one.

- The intention with this boilerplate is also to include some of the more common features such as login and a classy mypage.

- The boiler plate also includes proxying so that everything to /api gets proxied to
